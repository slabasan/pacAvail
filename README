========================================
Motivation:
There were three locations on Pacific's campus that served dual-purpose as a
classroom and as a 24/7 computer laboratory with engineering software. Near the
beginning of the semester, an admin manually goes through InsidePacific and
creates a calendar that identifies when the room is occupied by a class. This
calendar then is posted outside the room, so that students are aware when they
can take advantage of the computers and avoid disrupting a class in session.
However, the beginning of the semester is also a time when the course catalog
is changing. Our program seeks to accomplish three things: (1) create a script
to generate calendars faster and with ease, (2) give students the ability to
access the schedules from anywhere, and (3) go beyond the scope of the
engineering students and provide calendars for all locations on campus and all
professors, so students are aware of when rooms are available and where
professors may be at a particular time. 

Our program takes a large data set and generates five-day calendars for all
unique rooms on campus and professors. Hopefully, all students will find these
helpful and easily accesible from anywhere. 

Files in repo: 
README					Obvious
archive					Delete folder and contents once confirmed they aren't
						useful
cleanedClasses.txt		Removes non-useful information from fallClasses.txt, so
						we can easily parse file	
creation.py				Creates index.html page
fallClasses.txt			Data set copied from InsidePacific
htmlfiles				Directory of all calendars and CSS files, all of which
						needs to be uploaded to webfolders
indexstyle.css			Style formats for index page
main.py					Main program
mkDict.py				Generates dictionaries for all unique professors and
						rooms
moveCSS.py				Moves two CSS files to htmlfiles
retrieve.py				Outputs cleanedClasses.txt with only lines of interest	
tableStyle.css			Style formats for calendars

Instructions:
1) Log into InsidePacific and copy all columns for the semester of interest
into a file called fallClasses.txt.
2) Enter ./main.pyc, which will (a) create cleanedClasses.txt from fallClasses.txt
by calling retrieve.pyc, (b) create a sorted list for all unique professors and
rooms from cleanedClasses.txt, (c) create a dictionary for every unique
professor and room, (d) generate index.html with links to five-day calendars
for all unique professors and rooms, and (e) move CSS files into the htmlfiles
directory.

Detailed File Descriptions:
retrieve.py		Reads from fallClasses.txt and write only those lines that
				start with a SR, C, or NR (i.e. remove all column headers,
				personal information, etc) to a file called cleanedClasses.txt
mkDict.py 		Does the following: (a) convert the start and end time into
				number of 12 min increments from 8AM (for calendar purposes), 
				(b) index the day of the week by a number ranging from 1 to 5,
				(c) use the previous information as well as information taken
				from specific columns to create a dictionary indexed by the 
				[time units and day of the week index] and assigned values of
				().
creation.py 	Creates index.html with links to five-day calendars for all
				professors and rooms for the semester of interest.  
moveCSS.py 		Moves the index page CSS and calendar page CSS to the htmlfiles
				directory. 

Future Work:
- Automatically run program to generate up-to-date calendars once a week
- Re-design webpage for more visual appeal

Suggestions:
- Add course and course number to calendar (i.e. ECPE 41: Circuits, ECPE
  41\nCircuits) Theresa 4/17/14
